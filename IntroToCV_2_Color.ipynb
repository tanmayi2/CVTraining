For camera and display makers, this is great news since if we can just stimulate these three classes of cells independently, we can simulate any color we want. The peaks of the three responses are at red, green, and blue. So we have our first color system, RGB.\n",

In other words, we can't pick frequencies that only stimulate one of the three cell types because their response curves overlap. So we can mix red and green light to look *similar* to yellow light, but not *exactly the same* as true yellow light.\n",

This fits well with the idea of a color circle. Saturation (S) roughly corresponds to how intense or saturated a color is. Finally, value (V) is intended to represent the brighness of a color, with 0 being black and 1 being as bright as possible.\n",

For instance, the difference between saturation and value is a bit ambiguous. Near the center of the HSV cylinder shown above, there's a big region of pale white colors that look about the same, even though their value and saturation are quite different.

These color spaces were originally designed when the first color televisions were being developed, as a way to separate a brightness-only signal for older black and white televisions from a color television signal.
